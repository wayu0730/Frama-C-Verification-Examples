# Frama-C-Verification-Examples
This repository contains examples of using the Frama-C tool for formal verification.

##Introduction
Frama-C is a software analysis platform for C programs that provides various static and dynamic analysis plugins. Formal verification is one of the analysis techniques that Frama-C supports. Formal verification involves the use of mathematical methods to prove the correctness of software systems. Frama-C provides several plugins for formal verification, including the WP (Weakest Precondition) plugin, which can be used to automatically generate proof obligations that can be discharged using external theorem provers such as Coq.

The examples in this repository demonstrate the use of Frama-C and its plugins for formal verification. The examples cover a range of topics, including basic control flow, arrays, pointers, and function calls.

##Getting Started
To use the examples in this repository, you will need to have Frama-C installed on your system. Frama-C can be downloaded from the official website: https://frama-c.com/.

Once you have installed Frama-C, you can run the examples by executing the following command in the terminal:
`frama-c -wp [file].c`
